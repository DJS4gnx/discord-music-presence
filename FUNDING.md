# Donating

The development of this project solely depends
on the effort of a single developer.
Your financial support allows me to invest more of my time into this project
and helps cover recurring server and domain costs,
which ultimately helps in making improvements
and working on [new features](./documentation/roadmap.md) that are waiting to be implemented!

You can choose between these options:

* **[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/musicpresence)**
  &nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; membership with additional perks
* **[LiberaPay](https://liberapay.com/jonasvandenberg)**
  &nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; option to donate anonymously
* **[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/ungive)**
  &nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; option for one-time donations, directly here on GitHub

Thank you for your support and your interest in this project!

Your donation will fund the following:

* **Subscriptions to music streaming services**  
  This application aims to support every popular streaming service.
  Testing Music Presence often requires me to have a subscription
  to use the service in its full capacity.
  I will be able to subscribe to more services
  and properly test the application with each of them.

* **Development time**  
  I've already invested quite a few hours into programming and refining
  Music Presence. Your donation reassures me that you appreciate my work
  and motivates me to keep improving it.

* **Future server costs**  
  Currently everything is hosted on GitHub,
  but I am planning new features for this application,
  which involves running a server that will have monthly costs
  associated with it.

* **Domain costs**  
  Costs for the domain **musicpresence.app**.
