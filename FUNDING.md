# Donating

The development of this project largely depends
on the effort of a single developer,
who is working on this application in his free-time.
If you would like to support the development progress
or would simply like to show your appreciation,
you can do so by making a donation.

You can choose between these options:

* **[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/jonasberge)**
  &nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; credit card only, directly here on GitHub
* **[LiberaPay](https://liberapay.com/jonasvandenberg)**
  &nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; recurring only, possibility to donate anonymously
* **[PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WJE4KJ45EZQUN)**
  &nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; one-time and recurring

Thank you for your support and your interest in this project!

Your donation will fund the following:

* **Subscriptions to music streaming services**  
  This application aims to support every popular streaming service.
  Testing Music Presence often requires me to have a subscription
  to use the service in its full capacity.
  I will be able to subscribe to more services
  and properly test the application with each of them.

* **Development time**  
  I've already invested quite a few hours into programming and refining
  Music Presence. Your donation reassures me that you appreciate my work
  and motivates me to keep improving it.

* **Future server costs**  
  Currently everything is hosted on GitHub,
  but I am planning new features for this application,
  which involves running a server that will have monthly costs
  associated with it.

* **Domain costs**  
  Costs for the domain **musicpresence.app**.

## Disclaimer

Note that donations neither grant you access to any additional features
