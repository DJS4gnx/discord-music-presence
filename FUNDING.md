# Donating

The development of this project largely depends
on the effort of a single developer,
who is working on this application in his free-time.
If you would like to support the development progress
or would simply like to show your appreciation,
you can do so by making a donation.

You can choose between these options:

* **[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/musicpresence)**
  &nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; *the preferred option for supporters with the following benefits:*  
  * Early access to selected new features
  * Updates on what features I am currently working on
  * A special Discord Role to acknowledge your support
  * Access to private channels on the
    [Discord server](https://discord-invite.musicpresence.app/)
  * All for as little as **1â‚¬ per month**.

Additional options for you, if you don't want a Patreon membership:

* **[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/jonasberge)**
  &nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; option for one-time donations, directly here on GitHub
* **[LiberaPay](https://liberapay.com/jonasvandenberg)**
  &nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; option to donate anonymously

Thank you for your support and your interest in this project!

Your donation will fund the following:

* **Subscriptions to music streaming services**  
  This application aims to support every popular streaming service.
  Testing Music Presence often requires me to have a subscription
  to use the service in its full capacity.
  I will be able to subscribe to more services
  and properly test the application with each of them.

* **Development time**  
  I've already invested quite a few hours into programming and refining
  Music Presence. Your donation reassures me that you appreciate my work
  and motivates me to keep improving it.

* **Future server costs**  
  Currently everything is hosted on GitHub,
  but I am planning new features for this application,
  which involves running a server that will have monthly costs
  associated with it.

* **Domain costs**  
  Costs for the domain **musicpresence.app**.

## Disclaimer

Note that donations via GitHub Sponsors or LiberaPay
do not grant you access to any additional features, like a Patreon membership.
