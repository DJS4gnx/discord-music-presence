# Donating

The development of this project solely depends
on the effort of a single developer.
Your financial support allows me to invest more of my time into this project
and helps cover recurring server and domain costs,
which ultimately helps in making improvements
and working on [new features](./documentation/roadmap.md) that are waiting to be implemented!

You can choose between these options:

* **[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/musicpresence)**
  &nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; membership with additional perks
* **[LiberaPay](https://liberapay.com/jonasvandenberg)**
  &nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; option to donate anonymously
* **[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/ungive)**
  &nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; option for one-time donations, directly here on GitHub

Thank you for your support and your interest in this project!

Your donation will fund the following:

* **Server costs**  
  Costs to run our servers that power features
  like using cover images from media players directly,
  without external images sources.
  This also allows me to invest in more infrastructure for future features.

* **Domain costs**  
  Costs for the domains **musicpresence.app** and **musicpresence.io**.

* **Subscriptions to music streaming services**  
  This application aims to support every popular streaming service.
  Testing Music Presence often requires me to have a subscription
  to use the service in its full capacity.
  I will be able to subscribe to streaming services, if needed,
  and properly test the application with each of them.

* **Development time**  
  I've already invested tons of hours
  into programming and refining Music Presence.
  Your donation allows me to keep doing that and invest more of my time.
  Thank you!
