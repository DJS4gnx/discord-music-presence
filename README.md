**Music Presence** shows your friends on Discord
what music you are listening to.

It works with any media player, be that e.g. Spotify, TIDAL or foobar2000.
When you play music with an app, it is automatically detected
and appears in the tray menu, as you can see in the screenshot above!

These are some of the most notable features

- Shows the **correct album cover 100% of the time** for every media player,
  no missing covers
- Shows the exact current playback position, if the media player supports it
- Fine-grained control over which applications are shared and which are not
- The tray icon changes and reflects
  whether your status is currently active or not

## Features

- Music Presence works with **any** media player!  
  Currently
  **[18](./documentation/supported-media-players.md)**
  different players are supported
  and adding a missing one is
  [trivial](./documentation/supported-media-players.md#my-media-player-is-not-detected-)
- Shows the correct album cover image 100% of the time!  
  *This works with any media player
  and is achieved without the use of external image sources.*
- Fine-grained control
  over which applications are shared in your status
- Fine-grained control over the appearance of your status
- Shows the exact playback position, if the media player supports it
- Option to switch between the "Listening to"
  and "Playing" activity type with one click
- Option to switch between the player name
  and "Music" as the activity name with one click  
  *This means you can either have it show "Listening to Music"
  or e.g. "Listening to TIDAL"*
- Shows the logo of the media player or streaming service
  that is playing your music in your status
- In-app and automatic updates of Music Presence,
  so you don't have to install new versions by downloading them manually.
  In addition to that you're always informed
  about any changes and additions with an informational popup
- The tray icon changes and reflects the current state of Music Presence,
  i.e. whether it is currently sharing media in your status,
  whether it's waiting for media playback
  or if it has been disabled by you entirely
- Obsoletes the need for other Rich Presence applications
  and specific plugins for your music player,
  by giving you unified controls and customization for all media players
  in a single place
- For TIDAL users:
  - Shows a "Listen to this song" button
  - Shows all additional artists, not just the main one
