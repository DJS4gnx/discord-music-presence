*\* This means Music Presence was only tested
with the paid or unpaid version of the player,
i.e. with a paid subscription or with the free, unpaid version*

<sup>1</sup> Using [this](https://github.com/th-ch/youtube-music) unofficial desktop app  
<sup>2</sup> From the developer "DryForest", [link](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nblggh67n4f)  
<sup>3</sup> [GitHub](https://github.com/Sandakan/Nora)  
<sup>4</sup> [Official app](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nvjbt29b36l) (only works on Windows 11)  
<sup>5</sup> [GitHub](https://github.com/digimezzo/dopamine), works with Dopamine version 2 and 3  
<sup>6</sup> Winamp only works when installed via the [WACUP](https://getwacup.com) installer  
<sup>7</sup> Not fully supported, your help is needed, see [this issue](https://github.com/ungive/discord-music-presence/issues/43)  
<sup>8</sup> iTunes for Mac only runs on Mac versions older than the ones Music Presence supports  
<sup>9</sup> Right now this only works by installing it via [WebCatalog](https://webcatalog.io)

## Additional notes

### MusicBee

MusicBee works well with this plugin:
https://github.com/HenryPDT/mb_MediaControl

The installation of such a plugin is required
because otherwise MusicBee does not report what it is playing to Windows.
Once you have installed and enabled it, Music Presence should detect Music Bee.

### foobar2000

While foobar2000 reports basic information out of the box,
this plugin will add the album name and a progress bar to your status:
https://github.com/ungive/foo_mediacontrol

This is a fork of an old plugin which I have adapted
to report missing song information.

### AIMP

AIMP requires this plugin to work:
https://www.aimp.ru/forum/index.php?topic=63341

Unfortunately this plugin does not report accurate playback information,
but everything else seems to work just fine.

### VLC

VLC requires this plugin to work:
https://github.com/spmn/vlc-win10smtc

At the moment this plugin does not report any cover images,
nor an accurate playback position.

### iTunes

On Windows you will need to run this helper program
for iTunes to report currently playing media to Windows:
https://github.com/thewizrd/iTunes-SMTC.
After that it should be detected and you should see it in your status.

iTunes on Mac is not supported as all versions for iTunes on Mac are too old.

### mpv

On Windows, mpv must either be run with `--media-controls=yes`
or by setting `media-controls=yes` in your `mpv.conf` file.
Otherwise mpv does not report currently playing media to Windows.

On Mac, you must install and run mpv using an app bundle
(file ending with `.app`),
otherwise it cannot be detected at this time.
Installing it with brew only installs a command line tool.
If you need Music Presence to work with the command line tool only
and you don't want to install an app bundle,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/ungive/discord-music-presence/issues).

## Players with known issues

> These are issues with the ***media players themselves***,
> not with Music Presence!
> Affected players are sometimes reporting
> incorrect song metadata or playback information,
> we unfortunately can't do much about that.

> Also note that the information here was gathered some time ago
> and might be outdated for some media players.
> Contributions with updated information are very welcome.

### Not working randomly

Some players stop reporting song information arbitrarily at some point.

- Windows Media Player on Windows

### Incorrect song metadata

The following players sometimes report incorrect song information,
like a missing artist, a scrambled song name or no information at all,
which might cause some songs to not be shown in your status
or only with incomplete information.

- Amazon Music on Windows

### Players with only basic playback information

#### No precise playback position

These players do not report a precise playback position
and will only show how much time has elapsed since starting the song,
instead of adjusting correctly,
depending on which playback position you jump to in the song.

- Amazon Music on Windows
- Amazon Music on Mac
- Deezer on Windows
- Deezer on Mac
- foobar2000 on Windows
- Qobuz on Windows
- Winamp on Windows
- WACUP on Windows
- AIMP on Windows
- MediaMonkey on Windows
- VLC on Windows
- Harmonoid on Windows

#### Incorrect playback position timestamp

These media players report a playback position
(which might also be imprecise, see above),
but they also say e.g. "this playback position is from 10 minutes ago"
even though the media just started playing and it should say something like
"this playback position is from a few seconds ago".
This only becomes a problem when pausing the song and continuing it later,
which might report something like "13:04 elapsed"
for a song that's 3 minutes long.

- Deezer on Mac

#### Missing album cover image

These players do not report the album cover to the operating system.

- MediaMonkey on Windows
- VLC on Windows
- mpv on Windows and Mac
- Podurama on Windows
