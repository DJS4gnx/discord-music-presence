# Roadmap

## Work in progress

- **Scrobbling support** for last.fm, ListenBrainz and libre.fm
- Support for **browser media** in tandem with a custom
  [browser extension](https://github.com/ungive/media-control-extension)
- A **Linux release** &ndash; you can already test a preview build on the
  [Discord server](https://discord-invite.musicpresence.app)!

## Planned features

- Listening along with other Music Presence users and your friends
- A button in your status that has links for the song
  to all major platforms (Spotify, TIDAL, etc.)
- Integrations with other platforms,
  so you can stream what you are listening to elsewhere in real-time.
  This might gain traction in the future,
  where other platforms can integrate with Music Presence
  in order to power listening along natively within your music player.
- An updated user interface with an actual window instead of just a tray menu
- Closing open issues and implementing suggestions from users
  [here](https://github.com/ungive/discord-music-presence/issues)
