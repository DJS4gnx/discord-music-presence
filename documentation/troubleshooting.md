# Troubleshooting

## My media player is not detected

Are you using any of the following media players?

- **MusicBee**
- **AIMP**
- **VLC**

If that is the case, please read the section **Additional notes**
in [**this document**](https://github.com/ungive/discord-music-presence/blob/master/documentation/supported-media-players.md) first,
it contains additional steps that are necessary
for these media players to be detected by Music Presence.

Otherwise continue reading the next section.

### Reporting an issue with a different media player

First make sure you played some media with your media player
while Music Presence is running.

After that, navigate to the **Help** menu and click on

- **Submit detected media players**

This will open a new GitHub issue with information about all media players
that have been detected since you started Music Presence.
Submit the issue and I will come back to you as soon as I can.

You will need a GitHub account to submit the issue.
If you don't want to register one,
you can alternatively copy the link in the address bar,
join the [Discord server](https://discord-invite.musicpresence.app)
and then paste the copied link in the `#troubleshooting` channel.
