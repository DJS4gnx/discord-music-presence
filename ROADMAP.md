# Roadmap

## Work in progress and planned features

- Listening along with other Music Presence users and your friends.
- A button in your status that has links for the song
  to all major platforms (Spotify, TIDAL, etc.).
- Integrations with other platforms,
  so you can stream what you are listening to elsewhere in real-time.
  This might gain traction in the future,
  where other platforms can integrate with Music Presence
  in order to power listening along natively within your music player.
- Browser support in tandem with a browser extension.
- Support for Linux.
- Community-driven translations of the application to other languages.
- ...
