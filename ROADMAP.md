# Roadmap

Last updated: 13.08.2024

## Upcoming releases

- 2.2.0
  - Adds the option to use the cover image
    directly from your media player in your status.
    No more missing album covers, especially for foobar2000 and MusicBee users,
    but also users of any other player.
  - A revised tray menu with more controls
    over which external services are used.
  - Automatic updates to new versions,
    so you don't have to install updates manually anymore (can be disabled).
    The roadmap is long and this project is very active,
    employing automatic updates allows me to make releases more frequently
    without fearing that users get annoyed of updating all the time.

## Planned features

- Listening along with other Music Presence users and your friends.
- A button in your status that has links for the song
  to all major platforms (Spotify, TIDAL, etc.).
- Integrations with other platforms,
  so you can stream what you are listening to elsewhere in real-time.
  This might gain traction in the future,
  where other platforms can integrate with Music Presence
  in order to power listening along natively within your music player.
- Browser support in tandem with a browser extension.
- Support for Linux.
- Community-driven translations of the application to other languages.
- ...
